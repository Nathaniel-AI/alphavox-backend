AlphaVox - Conversation Bridge Module
-------------------------------------
This module bridges between various analysis components (eye tracking, nonverbal, etc.)
and the conversation generation, enabling multi-modal communication.

The bridge processes analyzed inputs from various sensors and contexts,
then generates appropriate conversational responses using AI models.
